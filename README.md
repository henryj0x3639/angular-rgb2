### Description

The AngularRGB is a, minimalistic, 40% keyboard that supports perkey RGB Lighting. We've noticed that there are no purchasing options for anyone interested in a rgb per key backlit keyboard, so we decided to create one.

The PCB consists of a 4x12 matrix layed out as a COL to ROW diode configuration with a staggered design. Additionally, there are slots cut out on the board to provide the space for the WS2812B-Mini RGB LEDs that provide the lighting. There are also numerous protection features, such as ESD protections for both the data lines aswell as the power lines; fueses protecting the precious microcontroller in a case of short circuit; and many more.
